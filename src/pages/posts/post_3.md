# Latex and Emoji

Hello, world! :wave:

## Using Emojis

Emojis are a great way to express emotions or reactions in your posts. For example:

- Happy face: :smile:
- Cool shades: :sunglasses:
- Rocket to the moon: :rocket:

## Mathematical Expressions

Markdown supports both inline and block mathematical expressions using LaTeX syntax.

### Inline Equation

The famous equation of mass-energy equivalence:

$E = mc^2$

### Block Equation

To represent more complex mathematical ideas, you can use block equations:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

### More Math

Explore more mathematical expressions like summations, integrals, and differential equations:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
$$
